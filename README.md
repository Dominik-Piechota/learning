### :man_technologist: About me :
- üë®‚Äçüéì: I graduated Biotechnology at University of Technology in Lodz. For half a year I have been learning programming in Python,
with use of libraries like Pandas, collections, Numpy, Matplotlib etc. 

- üë®üíª: I learn on my own relying on free courses, official documentations and some books like "Python for Programmers". Basically,  in case of learning by practice, I create programs and scripts, part of them can be checked on repository.

- ‚ö°: During my free time, I solve exercises on web: [![Badges](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dominik-exercism-informational?style=plastic&logo=appveyor)](https://exercism.org/profiles/Dominik-Piechota)

### üìë Projects' description :
1. "Genetyka":
Program that functions and operations on DNA and RNA. At the beginning, program needs a file containing sequence, it can be in .txt or FASTA format. Then, it shows operations, that can be done:  
   - Base DNA cleaning
   - A, T, G, C counting (with optional %GC)
   - Obtaining RNA after transcription process of DNA sequence which was provided
  or obtaining a strand complementary to the inserted one.
   - Get Amino-acids sequence based on DNA 
   - Check for the specific pattern in sequence.
   - Split sequences based on pattern occurrence
Whole analysis can be finished with writing new sequence to new file.

2. "Project_1":
This is the part of data analysis. It starts with opening the file(csv). Whole analysis are done after converting file to DataFrame with pandas. Then I did some major analysis, delivering informations, filtering over the columns and values and creating graphs: density plots, histograms, pie plots etc. based on it. The libraries used in project: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.

3. "String_calculator": 
Program providing basic calculations, but based not on simply numbers, but on strings, given by user. It was created for practising regex library, which was used in it. 

4. "Project_2": 
Data analysis of sales in 2019 provided in free databases. The libraries I used for data analysis: pandas, numpy, matplotlib. Whole analysis are done after converting file to DataFrame with pandas.
I checked multiple values like: age of customers, items that were sold, revenue and corelations between values in columns.
